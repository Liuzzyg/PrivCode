{"problem": "You are tasked with writing a script to automate the installation of Apache Giraph and Zookeeper on a Unix-based system.

Download the Apache Giraph prebuilt package from the given URL and extract it to a directory specified by the `$PREFIX` environment variable. Create a symbolic link named `giraph` pointing to the extracted directory.\n2. Display a message indicating the installation of Zookeeper is starting.\n3.
