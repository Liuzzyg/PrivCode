{"problem": "You are given a chocolate bar that is represented by an array of integers, where each integer represents the number of squares of chocolate in a segment. Ron's birthday is in month m, and the sum of the integers on the squares must equal his birth day, represented by d. You need to determine how many ways the chocolate bar can be divided such that the length of the segment matches Ron's birth month and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.\n\nWrite a function `birthday(s, d, m)` that takes in the following parameters:\n- An array of integers `s` representing the numbers on each of the squares of chocolate.\n- An integer `d` representing Ron's birth day.\n- An integer `m` representing Ron's birth month.\n\nThe function should return an integer representing the number of ways the chocolate can be divided according to the given criteria.\n\nFunction signature: `def birthday(s: List[int], d: int, m: int) -> int`\n\n**Constraints:**\n- 1 <= n <= 100, where n is the length of the chocolate bar.\n- 1 <= s[i] <= 5, where 0 <= i < n.\n- 1 <= d <= 31, representing the day of the month.\n- 1 <= m <= 12, representing the month.\n\nExample:\n```python\ns = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]\nd = 3\nm = 2\nprint(birthday(s, d, m))  # Output: 2\n```", "solution": "```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef birthday(s: List[int], d: int, m: int) -> int:\n    number_divided = 0\n    number_iteration = len(s) - (m - 1)\n    for i in range(number_iteration):\n        if sum(s[i:i+m]) == d:\n            number_divided += 1\n    return number_divided\n```\n\nThe solution defines a function `birthday` that iterates through the chocolate bar segments to find the number of ways it can be divided according to the given criteria. It initializes `number_divided` to 0 and calculates the `number_iteration` based on the length of the chocolate bar and Ron's birth month. Then, it iterates through the segments and checks if the sum of integers in a segment matches Ron's birth day. If it does, the `number_divided` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the `number_divided` as the result."}
{"problem": "You are tasked with creating a program to simulate the birthday paradox. The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a greater than 50% chance that at least two people have the same birthday. Your task is to write a function `count_positives(students, simulations)` that generates simulations of students and counts how many of them have at least one pair of students with the same birthday.\n\nThe function should take in two parameters:\n- `students`: an integer representing the number of students in each simulation.\n- `simulations`: an integer representing the number of simulations to run.\n\nThe function should return the count of simulations where at least one pair of students share the same birthday.\n\nFor example, if `students = 23` and `simulations = 1000`, the function should generate 1000 simulations of 23 students each and count how many of them have at least one pair of students with the same birthday.", "solution": "```python\nimport random\n\ndef count_positives(students, simulations):\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(simulations):\n        birthdays = set()\n        for _ in range(students):\n            birthday = random.randint(1, 365)  # Assuming non-leap year\n            if birthday in birthdays:\n                count += 1\n                break\n            birthdays.add(birthday)\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `count_positives` function initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of simulations where at least one pair of students share the same birthday. It then iterates through the specified number of simulations, generating a set of unique random birthdays for each simulation. If a duplicate birthday is encountered within a simulation, the counter is incremented, and the loop breaks to move on to the next simulation. Finally, the function returns the count of simulations where at least one pair of students share the same birthday."}
